# Privacy-Preserving Workspace Booking System

A secure and privacy-first workspace booking system designed for co-working spaces, hotels, and shared offices. The platform allows users to book desks and rooms according to encrypted personal preferences (e.g., quiet, window-side) without revealing their actual working habits to the service provider. Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the platform to perform preference matching and booking operations while keeping all sensitive user data private.

## Introduction

Traditional workspace booking platforms require users to disclose personal preferences and working patterns to centralized operators. This creates significant risks:

- **Loss of privacy**: Operators can infer personal habits, such as working hours or preference for quiet environments.  
- **Data misuse**: Sensitive data could be shared or sold without consent.  
- **Targeted profiling**: Users may become subject to unwanted marketing or surveillance based on usage behavior.  

This project eliminates these risks by integrating **Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** into the booking workflow. Preferences remain encrypted throughout the process, ensuring that even the platform cannot learn a user’s personal habits.

## Why FHE Matters

FHE allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data. For this system, it means:

- User preferences are encrypted before leaving their device.  
- The booking system applies the matching algorithm entirely on encrypted inputs.  
- Results are also encrypted, only decrypted locally by the user.  

Thus, no one — not even administrators or system operators — can view or misuse user data. This ensures **confidentiality, trust, and true user control**.

## Core Features

### Encrypted Preference Matching
- Users define preferences such as desk type, noise level, or proximity to windows.  
- Preferences are encrypted using FHE before being sent to the platform.  
- Matching occurs without ever exposing raw user preferences.  

### Anonymous Booking
- Reservations are processed under encryption.  
- Users can complete bookings without attaching identifiable metadata.  
- Payment integrations support anonymous or pseudonymous settlement.  

### Secure Access Control
- Bookings are linked to encrypted tokens for gate access.  
- Doors and check-in kiosks verify valid reservations without learning personal details.  

### Multi-Platform Support
- Accessible through web and mobile applications.  
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing co-working management software.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Client Applications**  
   - Web and mobile interfaces for preference input and booking confirmation.  
   - Local encryption/decryption ensures sensitive data never leaves user control.  

2. **Booking Engine with FHE**  
   - Executes encrypted matching algorithms.  
   - Stores only encrypted reservation data.  

3. **Access Integration Layer**  
   - Provides APIs for door locks, front-desk systems, and kiosk devices.  
   - Verifies bookings without exposing user identity.  

### Workflow Overview
1. User inputs preferences locally.  
2. Preferences are encrypted with FHE and sent to the booking engine.  
3. Matching occurs under encryption.  
4. Booking confirmation (still encrypted) is returned to the client.  
5. The client decrypts confirmation and generates an access token.

## Security Principles

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data encrypted at the client, never exposed in plaintext.  
- **Homomorphic Matching**: No preference data is ever visible to the platform.  
- **Anonymous Payments**: Supports privacy-friendly settlement options.  
- **Immutable Logs**: Booking records are auditable without exposing private details.

## Technology Stack

- **Concrete**: For implementing FHE operations.  
- **Python**: Backend logic, booking workflows, and encrypted computation orchestration.  
- **Web/Mobile App**: User-facing applications with local encryption.  

---

## Example Usage

1. A user specifies preferences: *quiet zone, near a window, dual monitors*.  
2. Preferences are encrypted and submitted.  
3. The platform finds the best available match using FHE-based algorithms.  
4. Booking confirmation is returned in encrypted form.  
5. User decrypts confirmation locally and receives an encrypted token for access.  

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core encrypted booking engine and client app prototype.  
- **Phase 2**: Access control hardware integration for gates and kiosks.  
- **Phase 3**: Support for group bookings with FHE aggregation.  
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics with privacy-preserving aggregated insights.  
- **Phase 5**: Expansion to hotels and travel ecosystems with privacy-first booking flows.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** can transform shared workspace booking into a **privacy-first, secure, and user-respecting service**. By ensuring that preferences and habits remain encrypted end-to-end, it redefines trust in digital booking systems while offering seamless integration into real-world environments.
